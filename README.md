# Smart Shoppers Online Store System

This is a demo store created as a final project for EECS3311.

In this project, I was tasked with creating an "online store system" for the purpose of practicing software design and development from scratch with design details, assumptions and decisions left for me to decide.

In hindsight there are many improvements that could be made to this store. The whole purpose of creating this store by ourselves as a final project and giving us the ability to make our own decisions was for that exact reason, that we would make mistakes, and learn many parts of developing a larger system such as what works and what does not work.

To run this project,

    Download all files

    Place all CSVs on desktop as we are using a simulated database

    Premade Customer signin: USER: customer PASS: customer. (You may create your own account if you wish).

    Admin signin: USER: admin PASS: admin

    Manager signin: USER: manager PASS: manager. (You may create new managers by signing in as admin).

    I hope you enjoy this sample store as much as I did. I had a great time making it and really learned so much.
